# **Transaction Risk Assessment Methodology**

## **Pre-Research Instructions: Extracting Key Information from Transactions**

Before conducting research, extract the following important details from the transaction data:

### **1. Key Entity Information**  
- **Sender & Receiver Names** (Identify inconsistencies, abbreviations, known fraudulent names)  
- **Entity Type** (Corporation, Non-Profit, Financial Intermediary, Shell Company, Unknown)  
- **Account Numbers & Bank Details** (IBAN, SWIFT codes, offshore banks, cryptocurrency wallets)  
- **Address** (Cross-check against tax havens, sanctioned locations, or high-risk jurisdictions)  
- **Beneficial Owner Details** (Verify against regulatory filings, leaks, or corporate databases)  

### **2. Transaction Details**  
- **Amount & Currency** (Unusual values, frequent transactions just below reporting thresholds)  
- **Transaction Type** (Wire transfers, SWIFT, cryptocurrency, correspondent banking)  
- **Currency Exchange (if applicable)** (Unusual or unnecessary conversions)  
- **Purpose** (Extract purpose notes, references, and check legitimacy)  

### **3. Additional Risk Indicators**  
- **Intermediaries & Routing** (Unnecessary intermediaries, offshore accounts, circular transactions)  
- **Approvers & Signatories** (Check for politically exposed persons (PEPs) or known risk associations)  
- **IP Addresses & Geolocation** (Use of VPNs, proxy services, links to sanctioned regions)  
- **Supporting Documents & Metadata** (Check for missing or manipulated documents)  
- **Sanctions/Watchlists** (Ownership structure, indirect control by blocked entities)

## **Post-Research Instructions: Classifying & Scoring Risk**  

### **1. Expanded Classification of Red Flags**  

| **Category** | **Indicators** | **Risk Weight** (0.1 - 1.0) |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Sanctioned Entity Involvement** | Direct/Indirect ownership by a blocked entity or presence on sanctions lists (OFAC, UN, EU, etc.) | **1.0** |
| **Shell Company Activity** | No clear business activity, offshore jurisdiction, linked to known shell networks (e.g., Panama Papers) | **0.9** |
| **Politically Exposed Person (PEP) Involvement** | Transactions approved by, benefiting, or linked to a PEP | **0.8** |
| **Unusual Transaction Patterns** | Large transactions without justification, frequent small transfers, or circular transactions | **0.7** |
| **High-Risk Jurisdiction** | Involvement of entities from tax havens, conflict zones, or non-cooperative countries | **0.6** |
| **Lack of Transparency** | Missing/forged documents, unknown ownership, inconsistent records | **0.5** |
| **Use of Intermediaries in High-Risk Locations** | Money passing through multiple offshore companies unnecessarily | **0.4** |
| **Mismatch Between Entity Type & Transaction** | For example, a charity receiving unusually high consulting fees | **0.3** |
| **VPN or Proxy Usage** | Entity consistently hides its location using VPNs or proxy networks | **0.2** |
| **Minor Inconsistencies** | Name spelling variations, minor data mismatches | **0.1** |

### **2. Formula for Risk Score (0-1)**  
\[
\text{Risk Score} = \frac{\sum (\text{Red Flag Category Score} \times \text{Confidence Score})}{\text{Total Categories Considered}}
\]  

---

### **3. Confidence Score Assignment (0-1 Scale)**  

| **Confidence Score** | **Definition** | **Examples** |
|----------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **1.0 (Very High Confidence)** | Multiple strong, independent sources confirm risk. No ambiguity. | Entity appears on the OFAC sanctions list with matching details. |
| **0.9 (High Confidence)** | One strong, verifiable source confirms the risk, with little doubt. | The entity appears in Panama Papers linked to known fraud networks. |
| **0.8 (Moderately High Confidence)** | Verified connection but with some missing details. | A shell company with unclear owners but linked to past financial crimes. |
| **0.7 (Medium Confidence)** | Strong circumstantial evidence but no direct proof. | An entity operates in a tax haven with unclear owners but no sanctions link. |
| **0.6 (Moderately Low Confidence)** | Partial evidence, but some key verification is missing. | A company has ties to a PEP but the PEPâ€™s involvement in the transaction is unclear. |
| **0.5 (Neutral Confidence)** | Some irregularities, but more research is needed. | A transaction was flagged due to missing invoice metadata, but nothing else suspicious. |
| **0.3 - 0.4 (Low Confidence)** | Minor inconsistencies, no strong proof of risk. | A company has a slight name variation in different databases. |
| **0.1 - 0.2 (Very Low Confidence)** | Weak, circumstantial evidence. Almost no risk signals. | A minor name spelling difference in a document. |

### **4. Final Confidence Score Calculation**  
\[
\text{Final Confidence Score} = \frac{\sum (\text{Confidence Score per Category})}{\text{Total Categories Considered}}
\]  

---

### **5. Transaction Classification Based on Final Risk Score**  

| **Risk Score** | **Category** | **Action** |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| **0.9 - 1.0** | **Severe Risk** | Immediate escalation. Likely involvement in illicit activity. |
| **0.7 - 0.89** | **High Risk** | Detailed investigation required. Possible sanctions exposure. |
| **0.5 - 0.69** | **Moderate Risk** | Proceed with caution. Further review needed. |
| **0.3 - 0.49** | **Low Risk** | No immediate risk but monitor for future activity. |
| **0.1 - 0.29** | **Minimal Risk** | No action needed. |

### **6. Output Format**  

The researcher must document findings using the following JSON format:  

```json
{
  "Transaction ID": "TXN001",
  "Extracted Entity": ["Acme Corporation", "SovCo Capital Partners"],
  "Entity Type": ["Corporation", "Corporation"],
  "Risk Score": 0.65,
  "Supporting Evidence": ["OpenCorporates", "Company Website"],
  "Confidence Score": 0.95,
  "Reason": "SovCo Capital Partners is not on sanctions list but an entity of interest. It is owned by Russian businessmen and related to Socombank PJSC, a sanctioned entity.",
  "Transaction Classification": "Moderate Risk",
  "Conclusion": "The transaction involves SovCo Capital Partners, which is linked to sanctioned entities but not directly listed. The moderate risk score of 0.65 indicates the need for further review but not immediate escalation."
